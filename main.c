/*********************************************
Welcome to our program: Blackjack Simulator
You will play against the computer for as many rounds as you would like
Your "chips" will indicate how well you are doing. 
You begin with 1000 chips. 
If you run out of chips before ending the program, you will go bankrupt.
Enjoy!
